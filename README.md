# Netflix Series Manager

I created a simulation of a Netflix-like system to manage TV series, created for a "Data Structures" course project. It organizes series in four categories: Trends, Documentaries, C Tutorials, and Top 10 in Romania. Key functionalities include:

- **Queue and Stack Management**:  
  - "Watch Later" queue for series to be watched.  
  - "Currently Watching" stack to track series in progress.  
  - "History" stack for completed series.

- **Command-based Operations**:  
  - Add series, seasons, and episodes.  
  - Display categories, manage the Top 10 list, and track viewing progress.

- **Implemented in C**: Using linked lists for queues and stacks.
